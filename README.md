Predicting attendance at college football games

#After years of declining attendance at games (possibilly resulting from increasing cost of attendance and increased quality of viewing at home) and limited or no attendance in 2020 due to covid, athletic departments are facing unique circumstances in 2021. 

This project will attempt to predict attendance at college football games using a variety of factors and models.  Time series and spatial factors.
